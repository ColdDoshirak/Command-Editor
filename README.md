Streamlabs Chatbot replacement for those who use Windows 7 (or Linux) One of my friends is still using windows 7 and his Streamlabs Chatbot stopped connecting to Twitch, so I made this app.

This was coded using AI as experiment, most of the features might not work or do unexpected stuff

Features:

StreamLabs Chatbot Command Backup compatible (but will not work for streamlabs import)
Auto-assign sound files from folder with same name as commands
Working cooldown and volume configuration
Response as bot account
Add/Remove commands
Twitch chat for commands
Auto-save each 300s and on exit.
Known issues:

Every textbox change doesn't change the table (only volume works)
Adding/Removing Commands while bot is connected to channel will crash software
This code is trash
There's no support for custom response commands, that include usage of Twitch API
Fork the code if you want to change it
